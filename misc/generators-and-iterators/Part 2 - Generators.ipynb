    "Generators can be used within other generators, which can be made quite concise with `yield from`. For instance, let's say we wanted to flatten an arbitrarily-deep nested list (which can contain empty sublists). Doing this with nested generators and recursion is very straightforward. Recursion works well here because of the nesting structure. And because the generators are stateful, they \"remember\" where they left off after each yield so we don't need to keep track of a stack or explicit iteration variables. "

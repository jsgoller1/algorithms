Design a Library Management System.

Consider a system where:
- Users can borrow books.
- Users can return books.
- Users can search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
- Books have attributes like title, author, ISBN, and status (e.g., available, borrowed).
- Users have attributes like user ID, name, and a list of books they've borrowed.
- There should be a limit to the number of books a user can borrow at one time.
- The system should keep track of the due date for borrowed books and can flag books that are overdue.
- Users should be able to reserve books that are currently borrowed.

Your focus should be on designing a set of extensible classes and interfaces that can model this system, 
ensuring good OO design principles. Stub out methods where necessary. Once you have a rough design in mind,
share it and we can go through it together.

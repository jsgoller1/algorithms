"""
Implements a union-find, based on Skiena's description
in the Algorithm Design Manual. Skiena's implementation
only supports integers, and at that can only support
ranges of integers from 1 to n, which is not very useful
beyond the demonstrated use for Kruskal's algorithm. In
this implementation, I would like to be able to store
unspecified amounts and types of things, as well as
add() and remove() them.

Because of this, we know that parents and children have an ordered relationship, but left children and right children do not, unlike with a BST. A valid minheap can have multiple possible in-order traversals, whereas  As such, we'd need to do additional work to get a sorted ordering - the typical way with a minheap would be to continuously remove the minimum element.

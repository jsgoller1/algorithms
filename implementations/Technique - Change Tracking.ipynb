    "This is a cool trick I learned from [@lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-obtained-of-any-permutation/discuss/854206/JavaC++Python-Sweep-Line) on LeetCode for efficiently handling some types of overlapping interval problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "Suppose we're given an array `ranges` where each element represents the start and end value of a range of sequential integers; `[1, 5]` stands for `[1,2,3,4,5]`. For each integer in each range, return a count of the number of ranges it is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: ranges = [[1,3], [2,4]]\n",
    "Output: {1:1, 2:2, 3:2, 4:1}\n",
    "Explanation: [1,3] means [1,2,3], and [2,4] means [2,3,4]. 1 is in one range, 2 is in two ranges, \n",
    "3 is in two ranges, and 4 is in one range. \n",

    "```\n",
    "Input: [[1,3], [1,4], [2,4], [2,5]]\n",
    "Output: {1:2, 2:4, 3:4, 4:3, 5:1}\n",
    "Explanation: Our ranges are [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4], [2,3,4], [2,3,4,5]. 1 is in one range, 2 is in four ranges, etc. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some constraints:\n",
    "- `0 <= len(ranges) <= 10**5`\n",
    "- For every `ranges[i]`:\n",
    "    - `0 <= ranges[i][0] <= ranges[i][1] <= 10**5`\n",
    "    - `len(ranges[i]) == 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brute force approach\n",
    "Using a counter, we could iterate through every value in every range and increment its frequency. This approach is `O(n^2)`; our worst case is `0 <= n <= 10**5` ranges each covering `0 <= n <= 10**5` values."

    "## Tracking changes technique\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that each time we see a range, all values between the start and the end have are now present in one range (plus any others). We can only get around the quadratic complexity by skipping these middle values. So instead, what if we keep track of the boundaries of each range, and then just track the number of times an interval begins or ends on a particular boundary? Then we can go linearly through the bounds and just look at the changes in the number of covering intervals at each index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's keep a Counter `bounds_counts`; for each range given, `bounds_count[range[0]] += 1` and `bounds_count[range[0]+1] -= 1` (this may sound weird, but hang on). If our ranges are `[[1,3],[2,4]]`, then the correct result would be `{1:1, 2:2, 3:2, 4:1}`. Using this strategy, `bounds_counts` looks like the following:\n",
    "```\n",

    "[2,4] -> {1:1, 2:1, 4: -1, 5:-1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, if we initialize `frequency = 0` and `frequencies = {}`, and loop over `range(1,5)`, adding `bounds_counts[i]` to `frequency` each time a value is in `bounds_counts` and storing the result in `frequencies`, the following occurs:\n",

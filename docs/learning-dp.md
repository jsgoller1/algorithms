## Struggling with dynamic programming?
Don't fret - dynamic programming is hard to grasp at first, and everyone struggles with it (including me)! I did the following things to learn dynamic programming:
- Watch Steve Skiena's lectures on YouTube about DP from his 2012 algorithms class.
- Read the DP chapter in _The Algorithm Design Manual_.
- Read these Wikipedia articles:
  - [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science))
  - [Dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)
  - [Optimal substructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure)
  - [Overlapping subproblems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_subproblems)
  - [Longest common subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem)
  - [Wagner-Fischer Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm)
  - [Partition problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_problem#Pseudo-polynomial_time_algorithm)
  - [Djikstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Dynamic_programming_perspective)
- Try 20 dynamic programming problems on LeetCode / HackerRank / etc., even if you need to look at the solution; the best advice I ever heard about mastering DP ([from my friend Oz](https://github.com/ozan)) was `don't assume dynamic programming is "too hard" for you until you've solved 20 problems using it`.
- Take Bradfield School of Computer Science's Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures class, if you can.

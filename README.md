# algorithms

Solutions to programming problems (competitive, interview, etc), and my notes on algorithms, data structures, and programming techniques. 

## Contents
Self-explanatory based on directory names, except:
- [notebooks](notebooks/) - Jupyter notebooks with explanations of various data structures, algorithms, and techniques
- [misc](misc/) - Questions mock interviews, friendly challenges, or other competition sites where I only did a few problems.

## Running
```
make install notebooks
```

## Credits / Special Thanks
I cannot ensure that anything in this repo is wholely my own work. Credits for obvious copy/paste are given as locally to whatever code sample or notebook is in question. Otherwise:
- Some leetcode solutions and writeups from [@lee215](https://leetcode.com/lee215/) and [@StefanPochmann](https://leetcode.com/StefanPochmann/)

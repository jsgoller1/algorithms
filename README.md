# algorithms

Programming problems, plus my notes on algorithms, data structures, and programming techniques. I store solutions from every iteration of interviews here, of which there have been several:
1. Oct - Dec 2018; first ever LeetCode grind, solutions from Bradfield's algos class and prep for an internal team switch at ATG.
1. Jan 2021;  switched teams from Uber ATG to main Uber org (5 weeks).
1. August and September 2021; preparing for external interviews (~2 months)


## Contents
- [notebooks](notebooks/) - Jupyter notebooks with explanations of various data structures, algorithms, and techniques
- [leetcode](leetcode/) - All of my LeetCode problems / solutions
- [patterns](patterns/) - Various software design patterns
- [misc](misc/) - Questions mock interviews, friendly challenges, or other competition sites where I only did a few problems.

# algorithms

Algorithms / data structures implemented for practice, as well as solutions to all of my programming competition and mock interview questions.

## Contents

- [algos](algos/) - Algorithms and data structures implemented for practice / training (mostly from Skiena's _Algorithm Design Manual_, Wikipedia, or research papers)
- [leetcode](leetcode/) - All of my LeetCode problems / solutions
- [misc](misc/) - Questions mock interviews, friendly challenges, or other competition sites where I only did a few problems.

## Building

To actually run code in this repo, I use:

- The Dockerized workspace that is automated via the top-level Makefile
- The Makefile system (see below for docs)

## Docs

This repo contains the following docs:

- [SUPER.md](docs/SUPER.md): a modified form of [Polya's problem solving method](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf) that I use for programming problems
- [learning-dp.md](docs/learning-dp.md): some general advice for mastering dynamic programming
- [unix-philosophy.md](docs/unix-philosophy.md): a reproduction of Eric S. Raymond's "Unix Philosophy"
- [make-system.md](docs/make-system.md): documentation for this repo's Makefile system

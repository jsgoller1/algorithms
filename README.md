# algorithms
Algorithms / data structures implemented for practice, as well as solutions to all of my programming competition and mock interview questions.

## Contents
- [algos](algos/) - algorithms and data structures implemented for practice / training (mostly from Skiena's _Algorithm Design Manual_, Wikipedia, or research papers)
- [codeforces](codeforces/), [exercism](exercism), [hackerrank](hackerrank/), [leetcode](leetcode/) - solutions to problems from various programming problem websites

## Building
To actually run code in this repo, I use:
- The Dockerized workspace that is automated via the top-level Makefile
- The Makefile system (see below for docs)

## Docs
This repo contains the following docs:
- [SUPER.md](docs/SUPER.md): a modified form of [Polya's problem solving method](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf) that I use for programming problems
- [learning-dp.md](docs/learning-dp.md): some general advice for mastering dynamic programming
- [unix-philosophy.md](docs/unix-philosophy.md): a reproduction of Eric S. Raymond's "Unix Philosophy"
- [make-system.md](docs/make-system.md): documentation for this repo's Makefile system

## 2019 Goal (updated 4/15/19)
After some discussions with my therapist about quality vs quantity in goals, I've decided that I'm going to switch to CodeForces instead of LeetCode and attempt to reach Master status by the end of 2019 (instead of just a number of problems). I will still be attempting 52 programming contests (having done one in 2018), with at least 10 being non-virtual ones (when I feel ready).

### Current progress
#### Virtual contests: 1/43
  - #511
#### Rated contests: 0/10

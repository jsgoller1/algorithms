# EPI (Elements of Programming Interviews)

This directory contains my solutions to problems from __Elements of Programming Interviews in Python__. The implemented solutions are all mine, while the test framework and data classes (i.e. code in `data_types` and `test_framework`) was copied from the book's [Github repo](https://github.com/adnanaziz/EPIJudge). I made a few modifications to allow the current directory structure.

Run with `python3 <solution_file>.py`.

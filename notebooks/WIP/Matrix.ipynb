    "## Tips for tricky matrix problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Python matrices are usually stored as lists of lists. I find iterating over rows and columns of matrices in any nonstandard way to be infuriatingly difficult in Python. I've developed two little heuristics to make it easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use `enumerate()` with sensible variable names\n",
    "To traverse a matrix from left column to right column, top row to bottom row, the easiest way is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for y, row in enumerate(matrix):\n",
    "    for x, cell in enumerate(row):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "This makes it easy to refer to other cells with `matrix[y+d][x+d]`, and also gracefully handles empty matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Use a \"cursor\"\n",
    "When you have to traverse a matrix any other way, avoid using loops; it gets hairy fast. Instead, think of a mouse cursor hovering over a cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT = (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)\n",
    "DIRECTIONS = [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]\n",
    "\n",
    "current = (0,0)\n",
    "is_valid = lambda cell,matrix: 0 <= cell[0] < len(matrix) and 0 <= cell[1] < len(matrix[0])\n",
    "get_cell = lambda cell: matrix[cell[0]][cell[1]]\n",
    "move = lambda cell,d: (cell[0]+d[0], cell[1]+d[1])\n",
    "\n",
    "while some_condition:\n",
    "    if is_valid(move(current,UP)) and some_other_condition(move(current,UP)):\n",
    "        .... \n",
    "```\n"

    "This is one of my favorite problems to ask in interviews - it doesn't involve any deep algorithmic knowledge, but it's very challenging to implement correctly because of off-by-one errors. I've seen two strategies for solving it:\n",
    "1. Try to set \"boundary values\" for each corner of the matrix, and move them inwards as you print values until there are no values left to print. I've almost never seen this work correctly without significant debugging. \n",
    "2. Based just on the dimensions of the matrix, you can predict the exact movements a cursor needs to make over the matrix to print the spiral ordering. This is my preferred approach. \n",

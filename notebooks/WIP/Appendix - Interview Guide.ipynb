    "\n",
    "Interviewing is controversial, and a lot of people hate it; I address this in [Addendum - My Horrible History With Interviews](#about_me). Set that aside for now and just start from a blank slate. We want to succeed at interviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some high-level things to keep in mind when dealing with interviews:\n",
    "- **Interviewing is a distinct skillset.** It is different from being a good software engineer.\n",
    "- **Interviewing is a learnable skillset.** No one starts off being amazing at interviewing.\n",
    "- **Interviewing requires specific knowledge**. Most questions are related to algorithms and data structures. You will fail most interviews if you have not learned this material sufficiently. Once you master it, you will find most interviews to be similar.\n",
    "- **Interviewing requires practice. A __lot__ of practice.** Several months at minimum prior to each set of interviews, for most people.\n",
    "- **Interviewing will be uncomfortable.** It will make you self-conscious. You will probably experience stage fright. It will hurt when you fail. However, you must not let any of this stand in your way. You must confront the discomfort head-on if you want to succeed. \n",
    "- **Failing is a mandatory rite of passage.** _Everyone_ struggles with interviews at some point, including the people who are best at it. Do not assume that you will never be good at it because you struggle at present. Just as you once learned how to write code through trial-and-error with help, you will also learn how to succeed at interviews.\n",
    "- **The person interviewing you likely expects you to fail.** This is not because of you, but because the _vast majority_ of candidates fail (especially at larger companies). Do not take it personally.\n",
    "- **You may fail anyway.** You should aim for never getting rejected. It is possible; as of writing this, I know one person who has never actually been rejected. However, interviewing is a noisy process that errs towards false negatives. If you do get rejected after thinking you prepared adequately, assume you didn't practice enough and vow to do more next time. \n",

    "## How the interview process works\n",
    "The flow for candidates is typically the same for every company, regardless of size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-technical call\n",
    "Usually you'll get some kind of initial contact with the company and a non-technical screening call from a recruiter or hiring manager to establish if you want to move forward with the interview and schedule you for a TPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial screening\n",
    "The first technical interview is usually a TPS or take-home assignment. At smaller companies, it is done by someone you'll work with regularly, whereas larger companies have a more standardized interviewing process with people who regularly do TPSes for other teams. It is is sometimes skipped for highly competitive candidates.\n",
    "- Technical phone screen (TPS):  This is a ~60-minute phone call. The TPS is a ~60 min phone call with an engineer where you'll be asked a programming question and need to write code to solve it.  The question is usually medium difficulty (see [Choosing problems](#choosing-problems)).\n",
    " - Take-home assignment: you get a prompt to develop a small software application and send it back to the company to review. Common examples would be writing a small RESTful CRUD application, a small game, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you fail the initial screening, you will likely be told that the company isn't interested in moving forward with you (though sometimes you won't hear back at all). Sometimes, you will get a second initial screening (usually a second TPS) - this is either because they weren't sure whether to reject you or not based on the first one, or (rarely) because their process has two TPSes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### On-site interview\n",
    "If you pass the initial screening, you'll get invited to the \"on-site\" interview. Prior to COVID, this involved physically going to the office; post-COVID it is sometimes done entirely over video chat. Either way, it is an all-day affair where you will do a series of one-on-one interviews (usually 4-6). The technical interviews will be done by engineers (usually from the team you'll join, assuming that's known in advance). They will usually involve:\n",
    "- Coding interviews: done by engineers, and similar to the TPS (though occasionally harder).\n",
    "- Architecture / distributed systems: \"design Netflix\" or \"build Twitter\".\n",
    "- Software design: \"Design an interface for a photo sharing app\" or \"create an API for scheduling ML jobs\"\n",
    "- Domain-specific questions depending on role: DevOps people may get asked about CI/CD and configuration, ML people may get asked about math or ML algorithms, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "On top of this, you will likely have a few nontechnical interviews, such as:\n",
    "- Culture fit: someone from the company asks you questions / talks to you to see how well you align with company values. Sometimes this is a very rigorous / standardized process with explicit goals, other times it's an \"are you an asshole\" test.\n",
    "- Hiring manager: the person who will be your manager will chat with you for an hour or so, and may ask you technical questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also likely have lunch with some number of your interviewers, which can be part of the \"culture fit\" interview. Very very rarely, your interview may conclude early; I've only seen this happen twice, and it was because the candidate did so poorly they clearly should've failed the TPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interviewer feedback\n",
    "Once the on-site ends, your involvement as a candidate is over and you wait until the recruiter calls you back to let you know if they want to hire you. This takes a few days, sometimes up to a week. In the meantime, your interview performance will be assessed. Sometimes this is a highly structured process with formal metrics (more typical at larger companies), othertimes it can be as simple as a conversation between two people (common for small startups).\n",
    "\n",
    "At most places I've worked, anyone who interviewed you submits their feedback in writing, and then hold a meeting to talk about you and make a decision. At most places I've worked, interviewers will avoid talking amongst themselves about you until this meeting to avoid biasing each other (some places even had a practice where they'd start the meeting with a countdown and then hold up either \"thumbs up\" or \"thumbs down\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of how a company formally decides on a candidate, keep in mind that it's **a group decision**, which means that there will always be biasing and \"groupthink\" going on regardless of how hard the company tries to prevent it. This has some important consequences: \n",
    "- If you have one or two interviewers who _really_ like you or thought you gave strong performance, they can pull the rest of the group into your favor. I once interviewed someone that I thought was such a good hire that I was able to convince 3 other people who were lukewarm to agree to hire them. Conversely, I've been lukewarm or mildly negative about candidates but reversed a \"no\" or \"neutral\" decision after hearing people strongly support hiring them. \n",
    "- Oppositely, strong opposition from one person can also cause an entire group \"lukewarm\" group to shift towards rejecting you for the same reason. This can make for a confusing outcome from your perspective where \"I had one interview that didn't go well, but I thought the rest were fine; I wonder why they rejected me?\"\n",
    "- If everyone who interviewed you is \"on the fence\" about whether to move forward or not, you will probably get rejected. The group attitude will likely shift towards \"err on the safe side\" by saying no to prevent a bad hire. This is a situation where you might get a followup interview/screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aftermath\n",
    "If you get an offer from the company, congrats! See "

    "We want to solve problems. The secret to doing this well is **thinking carefully about the problem we're trying to solve**. This might sound ridiculous, but it's extremely common for people to get stuck with code that doesn't work because they didn't think hard enough about the problem first. My approach for thinking about problems is based on [Polya's problem solving method](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf), which I learned from Bradfield: \n",

    "- **Review** your results.\n",

However, in every scenario **we should not solve problems we don't understand.** Starting by proposing solutions instead of thinking about the problem generally ensures a disaster will occur. "

    "## State the problem\n",
    "The very first thing to do is **give an exact statement of the problem**. In these notes, we will do this by asking three core questions:\n",
    "- What is the expected input?\n",
    "- What is the expected output?\n",
    "- What constraints exist for both the input and the output?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a problem requiring sorting an array of integers can be stated as:\n",
    "- **Input**: An collection of `n` integers called `arr`.\n",
    "- **Output**: The same collection of `n` integers such that`arr[i] < arr[i+1]` holds for all `i` such that `0 <= i <= n-1`. \n",
    "- **Constraints**: \n",
    "    - `arr` contains only integers, which may be non-unique\n",
    "    - `-(2^31)-1 <= arr[i] <= (2^31)-1`\n",
    "    - `0 <= n <= 10^7`\n",
    "    - The input collection may be in any order (including already sorted!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Failing to do this first risks crafting a solution based on faulty assumptions. What if our program assumes all entries in `arr` are unique and fails otherwise? What if it takes 3 hours to run when the array size exceeds 10^6? What if it crashes when the array is already sorted? And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good questions to ask at this step are:\n",
    " * What are the types for the expected input and output? \n",
    " * How large or small can the input be? \n",
    " * For collections of values, what range of values can be expected in the collection?\n",
    " * How much memory do we have available? \n",
    " * What is the expected performance of the solution? What complexity classes are allowable?\n",
    " * What is the expected usage pattern of the code we will write? Are we designing an isolated function merely to solve an academic problem, or are we mocking a library method that someone would actually use? If the latter, who will use it? How will they use it? \n",
    " * How likely is it we will need to extend your solution to cover more cases once the initial ones are covered?"

    "## Understand the problem\n",
    "Once we've exhausted all meaningful questions about the problem, we're still not ready to write code. Our goal at this step is to **gain insight about the problem**. Simpler problems often have an easy-but-inefficient approach (e.g. brute-force), but also a less obvious but more efficient approach. Harder problems sometimes have _no_ obvious approach, and we can't make any progress without thinking about them. We need to play with the problem until we have an \"aha!\" moment lending itself to a solution. If you find yourself getting stuck at this step, don't panic! Having insights comes from practice, so it's just a signal that you need to practice more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to do here are:\n",
    " * Try listing small inputs and what their correct output should be. If the input size can be between 0 and 10^6, try solving n=3, n=4, and n=5 by hand and seeing if a common pattern emerges.\n",
    " * Try drawing a picture of the problem, or coming up with a visual representation of the input data and expected output. \n",
    " * What cases _could_ occur given the problem statement, even if we don't expect them? List some of them. Is a null/empty input possible? What about a singleton input?\n",
    " * What work _must_ we do? Do you have to look at every portion of the input? Is there a way to avoid doing unnecessary work?\n",
    " * If the problem is too complicated, can we try solving a simpler version of it? Does it become much easier by relaxing some of the constraints? Can we build a full solution from a simpler one?\n",
    " * Is the problem similar to a well known problem in computer science, such as Travelling Salesman, Nurse Scheduling, Longest Common Subsequence, etc?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific patterns to watch for\n",
    "Some problems easily lend themselves to specific data structures or algorithms. However, avoid the urge to frame problems as though they were created with a particular technique in mind, i.e. `is this a dynamic programming problem`? Many problems have multiple approaches and the first one we think of may not be optimal, so instead ask `can I use dynamic programming here`? Some cases to consider:\n",
    "* Linked lists - do we need to derefrence the current item to get the next one?\n",
    "* Array with two pointers / sliding window - is having two indexes or pointers to a \"region\" of input helpful?\n",
    "* Stack - Should processing occur in last-in, first-out order?\n",
    "* Queues - Should processing occur in first-in, first out order?\n",
    "* Trees - Is there an obvious parent-child relationship?\n",
    "* Binary search / BSTs - Can we exclude half the input data at each step?\n",
    "* Graphs - If we think of the problem as a graph, what would the nodes represent? What would the edges represent? Would it be directed? Cyclic? Weighted?\n",
    "* Backtracking / exhaustive search - Should we try every possible answer? Is it possible we might get to a partial answer but go down a wrong path and need to bail out?\n",
    "* Recursion - What is my base case / termination condition? When do I need to recurse?\n",
    "* Sorting - Is the problem simpler to think about if the input is always in some order?\n",
    "* Randomization - Is the problem simpler to think about if the input is _never_ in any order? Does this remove some bad edge cases?\n",
    "* Math - Is there some simple equation that describes the problem and explicitly calculates the answer?\n",
    "* Binary - Do we have a limited number of things that only need a simple \"yes-or-no\" representation, such as set inclusion? Can binary operations like XOR or AND be used to simplify mutating state? Can we represent the input or state with a bit string?\n",
    "* Dynamic programming - Does the problem have cases that depend on other cases (i.e. a recurrence)? Do they overlap? Am I seeing that bigger cases are combinations of smaller cases? Do I need to find out `how many different ways` using combinations of things? "

    "## Plan the approach\n",
    "We're still not ready to write code yet, but now we can start thinking about a solution. This is the step where we usually write pseudocode and try it on some cases by hand. We may also realize we haven't thought about the problem enough (e.g. our approach actually failed on some important cases) and go back to the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also must ask about the performance of our proposed solution - what space and runtime complexity classes does it belong to? Are they optimal? Keep Knuth's old saying in mind: \"premature optimization is the root of all evil.\" We are _not_ trying to tune every possible inefficiency out of our code - we just want to make sure it's not so inefficient that it fails to solve the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific edge cases to watch for\n",
    "You may be considering a solution using a data structure or algorithm in the previous section in your solution, e.g. implementing a tree traversal (or you be forced to use one in the problem statement). Take a moment to think about edge cases unique to the data structure.  \n",

    "When you do find an edge case, consider how impactful it is to your approach and whether it's worth the extra work to rule out. If 1% of given inputs cause your solution to fail or work slowly but fixing them makes your solution vastly more complicated, it may be better to just reject the input,or emit a warning message and consciously do the wrong thing (this is called \"[worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better)\"). If half the inputs or even a few critical ones fail, you probably want to pick a different approach.\n",

    "**General**\n",
    "- Data structure is huge; has 10^9 nodes, elements, possible values, etc.\n",
    "- All elements in the data structure are identical (or different) \n",
    "- Data structure can't fit entirely in memory or memory is very limited \n",
    "- Data structure has a single element, node, possible value, etc.\n",

    "- Collection contains elements with heterogeneous types\n",
    "- Methods (`push`, `pop`, `peek`) are called 10^9 times, are called without calling any other methods, or are called on an empty collection. \n",
    "- An invalid index is given (if indexing is allowed). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Trees** \n",
    "- Tree is full - every node has max possible children.\n",
    "- Tree is lopsided / unbalanced - every node has only one child in the same position (e.g. a binary tree where every node has only a left child or no children, which is a linked list)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graphs**\n",
    "- Graph contains cycles\n",

    "## Execute the approach\n",
    "Once we have an approach we're comfortable with, we are finally ready to write code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Muntzing\n",
    "One strategy I consciously take with interviews (and coding in general is): **get it working even if it's ugly, then clean it up**. My first and most important goal is to actually produce a working solution. While I'm working on an implementation, my code will be littered with comments, copy-and-paste, inconsistently named variables, etc.- this isn't a violin concert where the notes have to be perfect when they're emitted from your fingertips. Make sure you communicate with your interviewer so they actually know this though: \"hey FYI, I'm going to start by writing ugly-but-working code and then simplify and clean up once it works.\" Note that if time runs out and you _don't_ get a chance to clean your code up, it can severely damage your chances of passing the interview. Make sure your final result is clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the code actually works and I start cleaning it up, I also like to do [Muntzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muntzing); I ask myself \"how many things am I doing here that I don't actually need to do?\" Can I remove unnecessary data structures, method calls, loops, or other things that complicate my code? The simpler I make my code, the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stub-and-compose\n",
    "Another strategy when doing an interview on an actual computer is stubbing what functions I'll use, adding comments, and then adding some tests that cover expected input so I can iterate quickly before diving into the implementation (you can use a modified version of this for whiteboard coding):\n",
    "```\n",
    "def some_subroutine(value):\n",
    "  \"\"\" <quick docstring about this function unless the name makes it obvious> \"\"\"\n",
    "  pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def some_other_subroutine(value):\n",
    "  \"\"\" ... \"\"\"\n",
    "  pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def main(value):\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "  <useful docstring that isn't too detailed but makes code more readable>\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "  # <might put a TODO comment here reminding me about edge cases>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # <comment saying what I intend to do here>\n",
    "  # <another comment about something else>\n",
    "  pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# I use assertions for tests during interviews\n",
    "assert main(input_val1) == expected_1\n",
    "assert main(input_val2) == expected_2\n",
    "assert main(edge_case1) == sane_result1\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above, note that I write multiple small functions and compose them in a `main()` function. This strategy will frequently make your life _much_ easier than writing a huge blob of code. When your code doesn't work, you'll be able to quickly isolate the issue without commenting tons of lines out. You can also write extra assertions and be confident that subroutines work so you don't have to worry about them. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional: use structured logging for clearer output\n",
    "Another helpful thing you can do when doing live coding on a computer (Python-specific, but other languages should have something similar) is use Python's logger library instead of littering your code with `print()` statements. Be very careful about this - sometimes `print()` is better because it's simpler; adding too much complexity earlier on might signal bad things to your interviewer. However, if you have a larger program with multiple subroutines, `print()` can get hairy. The snippet below will configure a `logger` so that it prints what line and function a message comes from, and you can just change the logging level to suppress output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "FORMAT = \"[%(filename)s:%(lineno)s - %(funcName)10s() ] %(message)s\"\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(format=FORMAT, level=logging.WARN)\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "def some_test_function():\n",
    "  logger.warning(\"This is a test message\")\n",
    "some_test_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "-> \n",
    "```\n",
    "[test.py:8 - some_test_function() ] This is a test message\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional: using a debugger\n",
    "Lastly for live coding, don't underestimate the usefulness of a debugger - breakpointing and introspecting variables can make nasty problems easy to spot. You may not always have one available during interviews depending on the environment or language choice, so make sure you can work effectively with just `print` statements. However, Python comes bundled with [a highly useful debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) that you use almost anywhere. Additionally, if you have your favorite debugging environment already set up on a laptop, consider bringing it with you to an onsite interview or asking in advance for remote interviews if you can use it while sharing your screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Review your answer\n",
    "Once my implementation passes test cases, I check in with my interviewer. I try to consciously transition to the review phase by saying something like \"ok, I'm satisfied with my solution.\" Most likely, you will get follow-up questions expanding the nature of the problem. Other common things that happen at this point:\n",
    "- You will be asked questions about how your approach could be improved.\n",
    "- You will be asked (potentially leading) questions about edge cases causing your approach to fail.\n",
    "- If you didn't talk about the performance of your approach (which you should have), you will get asked about it here. Don't let this be the first time it's discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For interviewers who are less hands-on, a good tactic here is to go through the above points and ask yourself about them out loud. Some key questions for optimization:\n",
    "* Does your solution do any work it shouldn't? Are you creating any intermediary data structures (especially accidentally) that are hurting performance?\n",
    "* How short can you make your code without making it unreadable?\n",
    "* Are you reinventing the wheel? Can you rely more on standard libraries or lanaguage primitives?\n",
    "\n",
    "For practice problems, check if anyone else has solved your problem before and take a look at their solution if so. How performant is their solution compared to yours?"

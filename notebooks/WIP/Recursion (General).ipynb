    "# Recursion (General)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion refers to self-referential algorithms. Any algorithm that can be solved iteratively can be solved recursively and vice versa (though sometimes the iterative implementation requires a stack, as recursion implicitly invokes the call stack). Some problems are easier to implement with one or the other; go with whatever feels most natural. \n",
    "\n",
    "When considering a recursive solution, you must identify:\n",
    "- A recurrence relationship in the problem. It helps to write this out explicitly.\n",
    "- A base case; this is a case where no self-reference is needed to provide a result.\n",
    "- A recursive case; the cases where self reference is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this, you can then begin implementing a recursive function. Here's a simple template:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def recurse(value):\n",
    "    if base case:\n",
    "        return base value\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return recurse(next value) + recurse(other next value)\n",
    "\n",
    "def handler(input):\n",
    "    return recurse(first value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your language allows it, you can implement the recursive function inside the handler function. I find that this is helpful if the recursive function needs to access a global data structure, but it can complicate testing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def handler(input):\n",
    "    def recurse(value):\n",
    "        if base case:\n",
    "            return base value\n",

    "            return recurse(next value) + recurse(other next value)\n",
    "return recurse(first value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common gotchas:\n",
    "- Not identifying the recurrence relationship completely before implementing the recursive function will cause confusion and possibly lead you to miss edge cases. \n",
    "- Every recursive call must eventually hit the base case; otherwise you will recurse forever. \n",
    "- A recursive function usually should return a concrete value in the base case or a combination of return values for recursive cases. A common mistake is to forget to return a recursive call's return value."

    "## Example: Tower of Hannoi \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Tower of Hannoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) problem is a classical example of a problem with a recursive solution. We can solve it recursively by thinking about \"subproblems\" - the 4-high tower (assuming plates 1,2,3,4) is just a 3-high tower sitting on top of a 4-plate. If we have some technique to move a 3-high tower to an arbitrary peg, we just move the 3-high tower to the temporary peg, move the 4 plate to the destination peg, then move the 3-high tower on top of it. How would we move a 3-high tower? Well, if we had a way to move a 2-high tower....\n",
    "\n",
    "The base case here is moving a 1-high tower (a zero-high tower involves no movement); we move it from source to destination. Note here that as long as we start with a valid tower (e.g. 4,3,2,1 with 1 being the top), we don't have to worry about intermediate moves producing illegal states - if while solving our 4-tower we solve a 3-tower, and while solving our 3-tower we solve a 2-tower, we still at every step only need to move smaller plates on top of larger plates. If we follow our algorithm correctly, we should always have a temporary and destination slot available (convince yourself with [this SVG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Tower_of_Hanoi_recursion_SMIL.svg); click the grey boxes to expand).\n"

If `root` goes into `left`, we don't need to look at `root.left` since every value in the root's left subtree is also less than V, so we go on to look at `root.right`.

In this case, we could merge them by setting `root.right = left`; every value in `root`'s original right subtree was greater than `root`, so this preserves the BST property. Then the recursive call's right is `right` and the original root is `left`, and we return both. Again, opposite logic applies if we examine `root.left` in the first case.

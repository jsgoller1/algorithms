    "# Recursion (General)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion refers to self-referential algorithms. Any algorithm that can be solved iteratively can be solved recursively and vice versa (though sometimes the iterative implementation requires a stack, as recursion implicitly invokes the call stack). Some problems are easier to implement with one or the other; go with whatever feels most natural. \n",
    "\n",
    "When considering a recursive solution, you must identify:\n",
    "- A recurrence relationship in the problem. It helps to write this out explicitly.\n",
    "- A base case; this is a case where no self-reference is needed to provide a result.\n",
    "- A recursive case; the cases where self reference is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this, you can then begin implementing a recursive function. Here's a simple template:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def recurse(value):\n",
    "    if base case:\n",
    "        return base value\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return recurse(next value) + recurse(other next value)\n",
    "\n",
    "def handler(input):\n",
    "    return recurse(first value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your language allows it, you can implement the recursive function inside the handler function. I find that this is helpful if the recursive function needs to access a global data structure, but it can complicate testing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def handler(input):\n",
    "    def recurse(value):\n",
    "        if base case:\n",
    "            return base value\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return recurse(next value) + recurse(other next value)\n",
    "return recurse(first value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common gotchas:\n",
    "- Not identifying the recurrence relationship completely before implementing the recursive function will cause confusion and possibly lead you to miss edge cases. \n",
    "- Every recursive call must eventually hit the base case; otherwise you will recurse forever. \n",
    "- A recursive function usually should return a concrete value in the base case or a combination of return values for recursive cases. A common mistake is to forget to return a recursive call's return value."

If `root` goes into `left`, we don't need to look at `root.left` since every value in the root's left subtree is also less than V, so we go on to look at `root.right`.

In this case, we could merge them by setting `root.right = left`; every value in `root`'s original right subtree was greater than `root`, so this preserves the BST property. Then the recursive call's right is `right` and the original root is `left`, and we return both. Again, opposite logic applies if we examine `root.left` in the first case. I won't bother stating the recurrence here since it's more confusing than it's worth.\n",

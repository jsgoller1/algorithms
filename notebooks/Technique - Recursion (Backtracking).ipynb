    "\n",
    "This problem is an exhaustive search - we need to find all possible IP addresses from a given string of ints. We can solve it with backtracking, or with straightforward recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying a recurrence\n",
    "A valid IPv4 address is of the form `x.x.x.x` where `0 <= x 255`, and x has no leading `0` (unless `x == 0`). Let's say that we have three types of IPs:\n",
    "- A valid IP address, e.g. `24.123.54.4`\n",
    "- An invalid IP address:\n",
    "    - `525.1.2.4` (field exceeds 255)\n",
    "    - `01.1.24.5` (field has leading zero)\n",
    "    - `1..3.4` (empty field)\n",
    "    - `1.2.3.4.5` (too many fields)\n",
    "- An incomplete IP address, e.g. an IP that is only invalid because it has too few fields:\n",
    "    - `1.2.3` \n",
    "    - `1.2`\n",
    "    - `1.`\n",
    "    - `(empty string)`\n",
    "\n",
    "For any IP address `s` and a character `x` s.t. `0 <= x <= 9`, we can either try adding `x` as the final character of s, or appending `x` to the end of `s` as a new field:\n",
    "- If `s` is valid:\n",
    "    - We cannot append `x` as a new field, e.g. if `s = 1.2.3.4`, `1.2.3.4.x` is not valid. \n",
    "    - We can possibly appending `x` as a final character: `1.2.3.4x` is valid.\n",
    "- If `s` is invalid, there is no way to append `x` to produce a valid or incomplete IP. \n",
    "- If `s` is incomplete:\n",
    "    - Appending `x` as a field produces either a valid IP (`s = 1.2.3, x = 4, s.x = 1.2.3.4`) or another incomplete IP (`s = 1.2, x = 3, s.x = 1.2.3`)\n",
    "    - Appending `x` as a final character produces an incomplete IP (`s = 1.2.1, x = 4, sx = 1.2.14`) or an invalid IP (`s = 1.2.99, x = 1, sx = 1.2.991`). \n",
    "    \n",
    "So given an input `string` of int characters, our recurrence relationship is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "all valid IPs ending at string[i] =\n",
    "    any valid result of appending s[i] as a character to all valid IPs ending at string[i-1],    \n",
    "    any valid result of appending s[i] as a character to all incomplete IPs ending at string[i-1],\n",
    "    any valid result of appending s[i] as a field to all incomplete IPs ending at string[i-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Base case and recursive case\n",
    "Because the problem says to use all characters in `string`, our base case will be: `current IP address is invalid, or current IP address is valid and i == len(string)`. The recursive case is `current IP is incomplete or i < len(string)`, and tries `append string[i] as character, go to i+1` and `append string[i] as a field, go to i+1)`."

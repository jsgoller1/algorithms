    "## Preface\n",
    "This ebook is about solving programming problems, mostly the ones focused on algorithms and data structures you'd encounter in coding interviews and programming competitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What this book is\n",
    "- A catalogue of what I have learned so far about solving programming problems, mostly derived from other sources\n",
    "- A collection of \"study notes\" for myself for when I need to review this subject (usually before a job interview)\n",
    "- A handful of tips I have learned about coding interviews\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this book is not\n",
    "- An academic textbook\n",
    "- A \"first course\" on programming, algorithms, data structures, or anything else\n",
    "\n",
    "I am making it public in hopes of it helping other people in the same way. Please note:\n",
    "- I am a professional software engineer, but not an academic or an official \"expert\" on this subject.\n",
    "- I presently do not have an editor, so there will be errata. \n",
    "- Any advice given here is based purely on my experiences and anecdotes from others; it is not truly empirical. "

    "#### Topological sorting is the easy part\n",
    "If we can construct a DAG describing observed letter orders in the wordlist, we can use a topological sort to get  a global letter ordering (assuming the DAG is valid). The hard part for this problem is creating the DAG based on the given wordlist and finding the roots to start the tsort from. In our DAG, edge `a->b` should be added if we find `a` precedes `b` from the wordlist; we use an adjacency list to represent this. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does the wordlist tell us about the lex order?\n",
    "- Word order tells us the order of their first letters (unless the letters match); seeing `[\"add, \"bob\", \"car\"]` implies `a < b < c`. \n",
    "- For any group of words with the same first k letters, their ordering tells us the order of their k+1 letters; seeing `[\"aaa, \"aab\", \"aac\"]` implies `a < b < c`.  \n",
    "- To correctly execute a tsort, we only need to know the immediate predecessor and successor of a letter - in seeing `[\"aaa, \"aab\", \"aac\"]`, we only need to store `a < b, b < c`. We don't need to store that `a < c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to form the DAG \n",
    "We can go word-by-word and examine the ordering of the letters. For two adjacent words `word1` and `word2`, \n",
    "if `word1[0] != word2[0]`, we can add an edge `word1[0] -> word2[0]`. If `word1[0] == word2[0]`, we must then test `word1[1] == word2[1]` and so on until we find a nonmatch or exhaust a word. If we exhaust a word, we don't store an edge - e.g. `[abc, abcd]` is the correct order but we learn nothing about `d`. Note that the wordlist is invalid if we exhausted the second word; `[abcd, abc]` is invalid. \n",
    "\n",
    "This technique can be used to solve [Verifying An Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to get the roots\n",
    "Once we have a DAG, we need to start from a node that has no parents; this is a letter that isn't found in any successor list. First, we should make sure every letter in every word is present in the DAG, even if it has no children or parents. Then, we can take the setwise complement of the keys of the adjacency list (i.e. every node in the DAG) with the union of each set of successor letters in the DAG. This leaves us with only letters who have no parents, i.e. roots. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Edge cases\n",
    "- Single word in wordlist. We aren't told what to do here, so I'm going to assume this is an invalid order (we have no way of knowing which letter comes first).\n",
    "- Letters with no obvious order. If we get `[\"abc\", \"qmk\"]`, we only know that `a` precedes `q`. I'm going to assume the remaining four letters can come in any order. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### A note about constraints\n",
    "The constraints of the problem are small; we have at most 100 words which are each at most 100 characters (so 100,000 characters total at most), and there are only 26 possible characters. Any approach bound by the number of possible letters is `O(c)`, so we could use a quadratic algorithm on set of letters. Linear approaches looking at every given character will also easily work in under a second (quadratic ones will not, though). \n",
